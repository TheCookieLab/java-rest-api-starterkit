# java-rest-api-starterkit

This is a basic REST API starter kit using Apache Camel and Spark. Running the HelloWorld application will launch an embedded Jetty server that will listen on http://localhost:9091 for 10 minutes. The following REST endpoints are defined by default and can be used as examples:

http://localhost:9091/api/v1/register

http://localhost:9091/api/v1/customers/{id}

http://localhost:9091/api/v1/customers/{id}/orders
